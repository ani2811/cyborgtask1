            Amphibious vehicle     
        </h1>
        <p>
            The name amphibious vehicle evokes a vehicle exhibiting “all-terrain” capabilities. Apart from land and water now-a-days these are even intentionalised to work on intermediates like ice, snow, mud, marsh, swamp etc. even on air-cushion. The first known self propelled amphibious vehicle was Orukter Amphibolos built by United States artificer Oliver Evans in 1805. Using a waterproof hull and a propeller, lightly armoured vehicles can be made amphibious. But for heavily armoured ones inflatable floatation devices are used as they need buoyancy to a greater extent than the lighter ones. For some vehicles spinning of wheels or tracks makes them propulsive while others use screw propellers or water jets.

         Robo Soccer      
        </h1>
        <p>
            Robot playing soccer! It is a specialized autonomous and mobile robot that is used to play variants of soccer. AquaBot Soccer- where the bot is made to play soccer in water. Robot soccer competition provides an excellent opportunity for robotics research. In particular, robot players in a soccer game must perform real-time visual recognition, navigate in a dynamic field of fixed dimension, track moving objects, collaborate with teammates, and hit the ball in the correct direction The main organised competitions are Robot Soccer World Cup (RoboCup) or FIRA tournaments played each year. The RoboCup contest currently has a number of soccer leagues including a RoboCup Junior league for younger students.

            The primary purpose of the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) has been to "move the state-of-the-art in aerial robotics forward" through the creation of significant and useful mission challenges that are 'impossible' at the time they are proposed, with the idea that when the aerial robotic behaviors called for in the mission are eventually demonstrated, the technology will have been advanced for the benefit of the world. Beyond those technologies and behaviors that have been demonstrated during past missions (full autonomy, obstacle avoidance, tracking, etc.) the following are emphasized:
            1. Manipulation of large objects 2. Fast outdoor operations over long distance 3. Interaction with moving frames of reference 4. Aerial robotic repair of mobile platforms
